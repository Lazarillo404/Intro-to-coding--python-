Write an Algorithm

Description: An algorithm is a set of instructions to complete a task. While we generally will speak about algorithms in terms of programming and the instructions we will write. However, algorithms can be used to write instruction for any kind of task.

Create 2 algorithms for tasks you complete on a regular basis. Each algorithm must be at least 5 steps long with clear distinct steps.
